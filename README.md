# college_API

This project process is to create SQL queries to support functional requirements, create a business logic layer to have API for each functional requirement using NodeJS, test and demonstrate results using Postman, and practice remote database connection and role-based access control.    

 

The following list is the functional requirements that the design should be fulfilled.
Functional Requirements: 
1) Admins should be able to enable or disable the availability of a course 
2) Admins should be able to assign one or more courses to a teacher
3) Students can browse and list all the available courses and see the course title and course teacherâ€™s name. 
4) Students can enroll in a course. Students should not be able to enroll in a course more than once at each time.
5) Teachers can fail or pass a student. 
6) Access control for Admins, Teachers, and Students: Ensure only the authorized access can perform an action. For example, only teachers can pass/fail a student. 
 
These steps are taken:
creating SQL queries needed to support functional requirements,
install NodeJS and all the required packages,
install postman application,
write a NodeJS and Express application to connect to the database,
add APIs to (D) to support functional requirements,
find a way to restrict access for some actions that need to be performed by a role,
finally test and demonstrate results of executing your APIs using Postman application.
